## The Probability Distribution Viewer
The Probability Distribution Viewer aims to give users the ability to:

- Randomly generate data points from 4 different probability distributions
- Select different characterstics of those probability distributions that they'd like it to satisfy
- And generate a graph of those distributions on the screen


## Overview
### Why Probability distributions?
In statistics, probability distributions (and densities) are a *fundamental* part to any statistical test. Therefore, understanding *what* a distribution is important. For example, a foundation of statistics, the linear model, is based on the assumption that the residuals from that model are **normally distributed**. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares)

### Why Graphs?
Though the mathematical concepts behind probability distributions are vital to full understanding, a visual helps people get a more concrete example of how they shift and move rather than how they're abstractly represented. And in my personal opinion, I find graphs to be much more engaging and fun! (though not everyone may agree...)



## Graph vs Formulae
For example, the below items both represent normal distributions (PDFs). However,for a beginner, understanding how a distribution *looks* will provide more context then trying to understand how a distribution comes about (i.e. with the formula). Plus, doesn't the graph look more colorful and engaging as well?

```{r pictures, echo = FALSE, out.width= "400px"}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("/Users/James/Desktop/Shiny_App/Normal PDF.png")

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
set.seed(1)
dat <- data.frame(x = rnorm(1000, 0, 1))
ggplot(dat, aes(x)) + geom_density(fill = "steelblue", alpha = .5) + theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Normal Distribution")
```

## Conclusion
Although mathematical formulas are necessary in order to advance in statistics, I believe that the ability for graphs to generate interest and engagement allows a much more effective avenue for introduction to probability densities

I hope that you enjoy using the Probability Density Viewer app, and the continuation of the Data Science Specialization!
